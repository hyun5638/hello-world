# hello-world

Hi world! 

Actually, not Hi... I'm not fine... I don't want to say Hi... or Hello... or Nice to meet you...

Why I now be living in the age of big data sociology? 

Yes It maybe would be the master key for the dream of social constructionist... maybe It really show us how people interact each other and make the world understandable... how the world = text be constructed... but........... but! but! but!!! 
Yes I know... It's time wasting that say bla bla bal yes I know I should do something... instead of writing this things... Yes I know...
