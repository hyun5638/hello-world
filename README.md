# hello-world

Hi world! 

Actually, not Hi... I'm not fine... I don't want to say Hi... or Hello... or Nice to meet you...

What the hell Why should I live in the age of big data sociology? 

Yes It maybe would be the master key for the dream of social constructionist... maybe It really show us how people interact each other and make the world understandable... how the world = text be constructed... but........... but! but! but!!! 
Yes I know... It's time wasting yes I know I should do something... instead of writing this things... Yes I know... Ha
